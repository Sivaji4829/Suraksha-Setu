Suraksha Setu

The Suraksha Setu project underwent a comprehensive development process. We began with Conceptualization, where we ideated and deeply understood the critical needs for disaster-resilient infrastructure. Requirement Gathering followed, identifying crucial features like real-time alerts, location sharing, human detection, and community engagement. The Design Phase focused on creating a user-friendly UI with futuristic animations and seamless interactions. In the Development Phase, we implemented core functionalities, including offline AI for enhanced resilience, dynamic updates on safe places, and a system for submitting critical needs. Rigorous Testing & Debugging ensured system reliability. Finally, we successfully Deployed all components, resulting in a fully functional web application. While this current version serves as a demo, for optimal performance and scalability, we plan to transition to a robust development stack utilizing high-level languages like ML (Machine Learning) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) technologies.
